- Should the events and errors be put in the spec?
- Should chainName, chainLabel etc be in the spec? i say no
- should we allow updates?
- Are the encodings in resolve correct?
- theres no way of setting 3rd level names. only way would be moving everything to use namehash
- check concat(CHAIN_NAME_PREFIX, _interoperableAddress)
- do we want natspec?
- do args have _ . make sure consistent
- events need to emit the node. also add in text record event
